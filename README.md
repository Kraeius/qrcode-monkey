This task just checks a basic QR generation via URL and a custom QR API post request. It's completed in 2 hours and 25 minutes. I spent a lot of time on slider but the result wasn't satisfying even thoug I could changed the default value.

I also tried to use API but it's not open to public I guess.

There may be better validations for test results If I had knowledge about the backend. Those are just my quick checks.

If I would spend another 15-20 mins. I would probably work on Free Signup feature.

Thanks!
